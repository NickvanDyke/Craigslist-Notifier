# Notifier
Given search terms, cities, and a refresh frequency, this automatically checks Craigslist for new postings, and emails the given recipient a notification using the given Gmail address when new postings are found.
Use by downloading the zip, extracting NicksNotifier.jar, and running it, following the instructions. The settings file is not very foolproof yet, so be careful to enter your settings as it says.

Why use this over Craigslist's built-in email alerts? Those often have very long delays between when a new ad is posted and when you are notified; I personally have received email notifications about ads that I had seen 6 hours earlier while manually searching. My program, on the other hand, will only experience a maximum delay of whatever refresh interval you set, with an average delay of the refresh interval you set divided by two. CL's email alerts also email you multiple times for the same ad if you have multiple search terms that return that particular ad, often resulting in needless email spam (I have experienced a LOT of this). My program avoids this, and only emails you regarding the same ad if it is updated or has a price change.
