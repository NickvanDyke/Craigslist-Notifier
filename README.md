# Notifier
Given search terms, cities, and a refresh frequency, this automatically checks Craigslist for new postings, and emails the given recipient a notification using the given Gmail address when new postings are found.
Use by downloading the zip, extracting NicksNotifier.jar, and running it, following the instructions. The settings file is not very foolproof yet, so be careful to enter your settings as it says.
